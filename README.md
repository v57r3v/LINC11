Individual Submission due: Wednesday January 29, 23:59 on Quercus 
Group Submission due: Monday February 17, 23:59 on Quercus 
The following exercises must be completed by uploading a   PDF   document   onto   Quercus.
Below you will   find   a   set   of data,   some background   information,   and   a   set   of discussion   questions   about this   data   and   the   topic.    Considering   the   data,   answer   the   questions   posed   to   you   in   prose   format,   using   diagrams   and structure   drawing   where   necessary   for   you   discussion, or   where   explicitly   asked   by   the   questions.
You   first   attempt   at   this   problem   is   to   be   completed   individually.   The   problems   in   the   exercise   should   be   chal-   lenging,   but   possible   to   work   out.      For   your   individual   attempt,   please   use   only   the   data   provided   below.      Your   answers   will   be   marked   for   effort   and   completion.    Your   second   attempt   will   be   completed   in   a   small   group   with others.   The   second   attempt   should   be   a   more   in-depth   discussion, taking   into   account   the   solutions   that   each   in-   dividual   group   member   supplied.   This   group   submission will be   marked for   depth   of discussion   and   accuracy of   the solutions and discussion   provided.
1                                  Persian   DitransitivesPersian   is   what’s   known   as   a   Differential   Object   Marking   (DOM)   language.   This   means   that   instead   of   a universally-appearing   accusative case   on   direct   objects   (for   example),   objects   are   marked when they need to   be   differentiated   from   other   material   in   the   clause.      The   marker   in   Persian   is   the   morpheme   -rā,1      which   appears   after   the   noun phrase,   e.g.    ketāb   ‘book’ becomes   ketāb-rā   .    The   cause   and   conditions   under   which   this   marking   occurs   are   rela-   tively complex;   we won’t be   solving that   problem.    In   this   exercise,   we   will   begin   by   examining   object   marking   in   Ditransitives, with   the   intention   of   see代 写LINC11 Winter 2025 Synthesis Exercise 1R

The   first   important   observation   is   that, like   many   other   languages,   there   are   two   word   orders   for   ditransitives.   Persian is an SOV language, so we either see   IO-DO-V   or DO-IO-V   orders:
(1)            a.            Maryam      barāye      mā       she’r             mi-xun-e
Maryam      for                           1pl      poem      ipfv-read-3sg
‘Maryam   will   read   poetry   to   us.’
b.          Maryam      she’r-rā barāye      mā mi-xun-e
Maryam    poem-ra    for                         1pl    ipfv-read-3sg
‘Maryam   will   read   a   poem   to   us.’
c.             ‘Ali      be      Sahar    gol dād 
‘Ali      to      Sahar      flower give.pst.3sg
‘Ali   gave   flowers   to   Sahar.’
d.            ‘Ali      gol-rā                            be      Sahar
‘Ali    flower-ra      to      Sahar dād give.pst.3sg
‘Ali gave a   flower   to   Sahar.’
Pay   close   attention   to   the   distribution   of   -rā in   these   contexts.   What   do   you   observe?
Now,   formulate   an   hypothesis   for   the   structure   of the   Persian   ditransitive   construction.      To   help   with   this,   consider one more   set   of   data:
(2) a. har    sag-i-rā be sāheb-aš dād-am 
every dog-indef-ra    to    owner-3sg.poss       give.pst-1sg
‘I gave every dog to its owner.’
b. be sāheb-aš har sag-i-rā dād-am 
to       owner-3sg.poss    every    dog-indef-ra       give.pst-1sg
‘I gave every dog to its owner.’
c. *be sāheb-aš har sag dād-am 
to    owner-3sg.poss    every    dog    give.pst-1sgDraw   your   hypothesized   structure   for   Persian   ditransitive   predicates.    You   should   illustrate   your   hypothesis   with   at   least   two   tree   structures   illustrating   the   sentences   above.    Now,   discuss   how   you   drew   the   conclusions   that you   came   to.   Is   this   structure   different   than   the   ones   proposed   for   English   by   Larson   and   Jackendoff?   In   what   ways?   Use structural illustrations and examples from Larson and/or Jackendoff   in your comparison between   Persian   and   English.
