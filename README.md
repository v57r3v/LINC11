1                                  Part   1:   Trees   (20   points)Draw tree structures for the following sentences.   Concerning features and movement, you may draw trees at their “final stage” (after movement and agreement), making sure   to use different arrows and   lines   to represent   agreement and movement as   necessary.
(1)          Urcilang   wants   to   win   this   game   against   his   brother.
(2)          April’s sister has   walked   from   Tianjin   to   Beijing.
(3)          The   ugliest   sweater   was   donated   to   Value   Village   by   two   young   boys.
(Value Village is a   proper   name)
(4)          Veronica   seems   to   have   broken   her   ankle.
2                                    Part   2:      Data   Questions   (20   points)
2.1                        Hawrami   DP   (4   points)
Hawrami is a Northwest Iranian language spoken in   Kurdistan   and   Kermanshah   regions   of   Iran   and   Iraq.   Consider   the   limited   data   set   below   from   several   DP’s   in   the   language:
(5)            a.            yere            knach-e    zerif-e                                        barz-e
three    girl-ez          beautiful-ez    tall-pl
‘Three   tall, beautiful   girls.’
b.            æ:               æsp-æ                     sya:wæ
that    horse-ez      black
‘That black horse’
c.               mashin-u      Hasan-i
car-ez.                  Hasan-gen
‘Hasan’s car.’
d.            pæl-u                              halo-i
feather-ez      eagle-gen
‘Eagle’s   feather’(ez   stands   for   Ezafe – a   linking   element   in   many   Iranian   languages   –   and   is   irrelevant   to   this   question.)   	In   class, we   argued   that   one   analysis   of   the   English   saxon   genitive   ’s   is   that   it   is   not   a   D   head,   but   rather the realization of   the genitive case   on   a   possessor   noun   the   specifier   position   of a   genitive   DP. We   took   this   English   morpheme   to   be   a   true   case   marker – like   the   genitive   marker   in   the   data   from   Hawrami.   Construct an   argument   from   the   Hawrami   data   above,   making   reference   to   the   provided   examples,   to   support   the analysis   that   genitive   case   is   not   realised   by   the   D   head   itself.
2.2                   Malagasy   (8   points)
Malagasy   is   one   of   the   few   languages   of   the   world   that   has   predominantly   VOS   word   order.   Simple   transitive sentences   look   like   the   following   in 6:
(6)          a.            N-a-maky                                                viliha           aho
pst-vactive-break    dishes
‘I   broke   [some] dishes’
b. M-an-asa                    haingana lamba amin’ny savony aho 
pst-vactive-wash quickly clothes with’det soap 1sg ‘I’m washing clothes quickly with soap.’Malagasy is   similar to   many other Austronesian   languages   in   that   it   has   several   voice   alternations   that   focus one element of   the sentence or another.   While the sentences above in 6 are in what is called   Actor Topic,   the sentence below in 7 is   in   Theme   Topic voice:
(7)             Sasan-ako      amin’ny            savony      lamba    wash-1sg         with’det      soap                  clothes
‘The   clothes   are   washed   with   soap   [by   me]’Lisa   Travis   has   argued   that   in   Malagasy,   there   is   an   active   v   head   –   which   is   realised   by   -an-   in   Actor   Topic   sentences.   This   prefix   is   not   found   in   Theme   Topic   sentences   like 7, providing   good   evidence   that   -an-   is   the   realisation   of   an   active-voice   little-v   head.Question: Describe   how   the   word   order   in   the   sentences   in 6 and 7 can   be   derived.   Which   items   (heads or   phrases) must   move, and   where   do   they   move   to?   Illustrate   your   answer   with   a   simple   structural   drawing (tree) that   shows   the   essential   parts   of   your   conclusion.   Additionally, do   you   have   all   of   the   data   you   need   to give a full account of   how 7 in particular   is   derived?   If   not,   describe   what   additional   piece(s)   of   data   would   be   helpful   for   determining   the   structure   of   a   sentence   like 7.
Data   for   this   question   is   adapted   from   data   in   Travis   (2010).   Inner   aspect:    The   articulation   of   VP
2.3                   Mongolian Accusative   Case   (8   points)Mongolian   is   a   language   with   a   variety   of   morphological   cases   that   appear   on   nominals   in   the   clause.   Unsur-   prisin代 写LINC11 Winter 2025 MidtermPython
代做程序编程语言gly,   direct   objects   in   the   language   appear   in   the   accusative   case,   indirect   objects   appear   in   the   dative,   and   complements   of   postpositions   appear   in   a   number   of   other   cases.       In   most   situations,   the   system   is straightforward   and   predictable.   Consider, for   example, the   following   sentences   exemplifying   the   use   of   the accusative and dative   cases:
(8)             Bi      xool-iig uurtaigaar      id-sen
I          food-acc    angrily                      eat-vrn.pst   ‘I   ate   the   food   angrily.’
(9)             Bagš                      surugč-id nom-iig ögö-sön
Teacher    student-dat    book-acc      give-vrn.pst
‘The teacher gave a book to   the   student.’However, the   accusative   case   in   Mongolian   may   also   appear   on   the   subjects   of   some   embedded   clauses (the   embedded   clauses   are   bracketed   here   to   help   with   readability).    The   sentences   in 10 and 11 are   exam-   ples   with   matrix   (main   clause)   verbs   that   take   finite   complement   clauses   that   appear   either   with   an   overt complementizer   (gež) or   as   a   nominal-ized   clause.
(10)             Bold      [Has-ig övčtei      bai-na               gež]                      barxira-na    Bold      [Hasa-acc    sick             be-npst    comp]      shout-npst
‘Bold is shouting that   Hasa is   sick.’
(11)             Bold      [Has-ig sogtuu      bai-x]-ig                                                               mart-san
Bold      [Hasa-acc    drunk    be-vrn.npst]-acc      forget-vrn.pst   ‘Bold forgot that Hasa was drunk’
On   the   surface, sentences   like 10 and 11 bear   some   similarity   to   English   sentences   like   the   following:
(12)            a.            I   convinced   him   to   wash   the   dishes.
b.            Sheila asked me to   send   a   letter.Question 1: Explain   what   the   sentences   in 12 (called   ‘ECM’   or   Exceptional   Case   Marking   sentences)   seem   to   have   in   common   with   the   Mongolian   sentences   in 10 and 11 above, but   also   identify   some   crucial differences   between   the   two.   (Hint:   one   major   difference   comes   especially   from 11)
In   addition   to   appearing   in   complement   clauses,   accusative   subjects   are   also   found   in   Mongolian   ad-   joined   clauses   (under   PPs   or   in   converbials   –   non-finite   adverbial   clauses):
(13)             [Dorž-iig ir-megč]                      Tuyaa      övd-sön
[Dorž-acc    come-cvb]    Tuyaa      sicken-vrn.pst   ‘As   soon   as   Dorž   came,   Tuyaa   fell   ill.’
(14)             Bi      [minii egč-iig yav-san]-aas                                       xoiš          Xöx   Xot-ad               amdra-ž      bai-san
I          my                   sister-acc    leave-vrn.pst-abl    since      Höhhot-dat      live-cvb      be-vrn.pst   ‘I’ve   been   living   in   Hohhot   since   my   sister   left.’One   analysis   of ECM   argues   that   the   main   verb   can   assign   accusative   to   an   embedded   subject.    Both 13 and 14 present   at   least   two   major   problems   for   applying   this   type   of   analysis   to   Mongolian   accusative subjects.Question 2: Identify the problems that 13 and 14 present for an analysis that argues that the matrix   verb can   assign   accusative   to   embedded   subjects.   Illustrate   your   answer   with   basic   structural   drawings   (trees)   to support your discussion.   (You do not have to draw a full   structure   for   any particular   sentence; just   illustrate   the   parts   that   are
essential for your discussion.)
3                               Part   3:    Discussion   Questions   (10   points)
3.1                        English   Auxiliaries   and   little-v   (4   points)When   we   introduced   the   vP   and   VoiceP   to   our   analysis   of   English,   we   needed   to   determine   whether   vP/VoiceP was   above   or   below   auxiliaries   in   the   clause.   Ultimately, we   concluded   that   auxiliaries   head   a   projection   that    appears   above   the   vP/ VoiceP. Describe   in   your   own   words   how   we   determined   this, and   what   complication    we   had   to   avoid   that   would   not   allow   us   to   rely   on   word   order   alone.
3.2                        Feature   Types   (3   points)Explain   in   your   own   words   the   difference   between   interpretable   and   uninterpretable   features.    Make   ref-   erence   to   the   benefits   we   gain   from   having   a   system   that   makes   a   distinction   between   uninterpretable   and interpretable features.
3.3                   Case   Alignment   Systems   (3   points)The   correlation   between   argument   structure   and   patterns   of   case   assignment   are   often   discussed   in   terms   of alignment.   You are most familiar   with Nominative-Accusative alignment.   In a Nom-Acc system, nominative   case is assigned to   whichever argument ends up in the TP, and accusative is assigned to the internal argument   of   a   verb.   In   an   Ergative-Absolutive   aligned   system, however,   the   agent   of   a   transitive   predicate   will   receive Ergative   case   (from   T)   and   any   other   argument   (including   the   sole   argument   of all   intransitives,   as well   as   the   internal   argument   of   the   V) will   receive   absolutive   case   (usually   from   v).   With   this   in   mind, explain   why we   call   unergatives   un-ergative.   Draw   an   analogy   to   unaccusatives   to   help   you   answer   this.
